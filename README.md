ðŸŒŒ Project Trinetra

Trinetra is a comprehensive Space Threat Monitoring System that combines real-time tracking and analysis of both artificial orbital debris and near-Earth asteroids. It provides an interactive 3D visualization dashboard with real-time alert capabilities.

ðŸ”­ Features
- Real-time debris tracking using Space-Track and CelesTrak data
- Near-Earth asteroid monitoring via NASA JPL APIs
- Orbital mechanics: SGP4, Keplerian solvers for accurate propagation
- 3D Earth model with satellite/asteroid overlays (Three.js)
- Risk scoring engine for threat prioritization
- Public-facing API for researchers and developers (planned)
- Alert system for close approaches or collisions

ðŸ§  Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Three.js, D3.js  
Backend: Python (FastAPI), AstroPy, sgp4, NumPy, SciPy  
Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS or MongoDB  
DevOps: GitHub, Docker, Vercel/Heroku (deployment)
